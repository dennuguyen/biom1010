Side Notes

-           References are well done

-           You have spent way many word on the industrial side of exoskeleton, too tangential considering you are only focused on the biomedical side (1-2 sentence on the industrial side is more than enough)

-           Report formatting is good and well written, however it does missing a lot of required information

-           VERY OVER WORD COUNT!!
